#### a) Clone the SAInt_HELICS_interface to your working space
  1. Open visual studio.
  2. Go to the *Team* tab and then *Manage Connections*. Alternatively, you can also directly access this by opening the *Team Explorer* from the *View* tab. Also, open the *Solution Explorer* from the *View* tab if it is not opened.
  3. In the *Team Explorer*, go to *Local Git Repositories* and click *Clone* (see Figure 1 below).
