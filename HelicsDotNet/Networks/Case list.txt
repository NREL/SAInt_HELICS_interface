Case list

Demo network:
- Demo: normal operations
- Demo_distruption: disruption at compressor station CS1

DemoAlt: Modified Demo network (similar to Demo but with coupled gens at different gas nodes):  
- DemoAlt: normal operations
- DemoAlt_disruption: disruption at compressor station CS1

Belgian network:  
- Belgium_Case0: normal operations
- Belgium_Case1: disruption at compressor station CS.CS_1
